# Citi-Bike-Sharing-Analysis

Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system serving the New York City boroughs of the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, as well as Jersey City, New Jersey, and Hoboken, New Jersey. This analysis was looking at key points of data - such as gender, days of the week the bikes are used, the user type, age.

## Results

# Checkout Times for Users

The highest number of checkouts is at the 5 minute mark. This suggests that many people are using the bikes for short, quick trips.

# Checkout Times by Gender

When we look at the data broken down by gender, while both genders have a spike in checkouts around the 5 minute mark, there are by far a lot more men checking out the bikes than female riders. 

# Gender Breakdown

Analyzing the breakdown of the gender of the user from the bikesharing service, we can see that more men participate in it. 

# Trips by Weekday per Hour

There seems to be increased activity for bike trips early in the morning during the workweek (around 8am) as well as in the evening hours (from 5pm -7pm). This might suggest that a lot of people are using the bikes to get to and from work. 

# Tripes by UserType (Weekday per Hour)

Looking at the day and hour breakdown by if the user is a customer or a subscriber - it is a noticeable impact that majority of the uses during the workweek at thos peak hours, are done by subscribers rather than customers who pay as they go.

Looking at the gender breakdown of what days and hours during the week the bikes are used most, men are using the bikes a lot more than women - especially during those high peak hours on the weekdays (8am and 5-6PM), 

# Customers

If we look at who is using the bike service more often - the majority of users are people who have subscribed to the service. People tend to be more likely to use a service more often if they are already paying a monthly/annual fee to take part in that service. 

# User Trips by Gender by Weekday

It seems that men are more likely to own a biking subscription. This could be because men tend to use the bikes more often. Or having a subscription to the bikes makes the men more likely to ride more often. 

# Birth Year of Biker User

It seems the most users of the citi bike service were born in 1969, while the users born in the late 1980's and early 1990's enjoy the service as well - they have higher useage rates. 

## Summary 

It seems the Citi Bike service is mostly popular with men, who own subscriptions to the service. They mostly use the bikes to get around during rush hour times in the morning and the evening - leading me to believe they use the bikes to get to and from work.
